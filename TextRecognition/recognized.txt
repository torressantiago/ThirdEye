restrained enthusiasm catch from one bystander to another.
They swing and bow to right and left, in slow time to the
piercing treble of the Congo women. Some are responsive !
others are competitive. Hear that bare foot slap the ground !
one sudden stroke only, as it were the foot of a stag. The
musicians warm up at the sound. A smiting of breasts with
open hands begins very softly and becomes vigorous. The
womenâ€™s voices rise to a tremulous intensity. Among the
chorus of Franc-Congo singing-girls is one of extra good voice,
who thrusts in, now and again, an improvisation. This girl
here, so tall and straight, is a Yaloff. You see it in her almost
Hindu features, and hear it in the plaintive melody of her
voice. Now the chorus is more piercing than ever. The
women clap their hands in time, or standing with arms akimbo
receive with faint courtesies and head-liftings the low bows of
the men, who deliver them swinging this way and that.

See! Yonder brisk and sinewy fellow has taken one short,
nervy step into the ring, chanting with rising energy. Now he
takes another, and stands and sings and looks here and there,
rising upon his broad toes and sinking and rising again, with
what wonderful lightness| How tall and lithe he is. Notice
his brawn shining through his rags. He too is a candio, and
by the three long rays of tattooing on each side of his face, a
Kiamba. The music has got into his feet. He moves off to
the farther edge of the circle, still singing, takes the prompt
hand of an unsmiling Congo girl, leads her into the ring, and,
leaving the chant to the throng, stands her before him for
the dance.

Will they dance to that measure? Wait! A sudden frenzy
seizes the musicians. The measure quickens, the swaying,
attitudinizing crowd starts into extra activity, the female voices
grow sharp and staccato, and suddenly the dance is the furious
Bamboula.
